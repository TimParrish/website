## Personal Website

This project is the second iteration of my personal website I created my first year studing computer science in college. Now that I have leared the ReactJS tech stack, I am overhauling this for fun. The site this is replacing can currently be found at [www.timothyparrish.com](http://www.timothyparrish.com) This is a fun project that gives an a opportunity to play around with new react packages that seem intresting. The collection of photos are ones that I have taken traveling around and wanted to share.
